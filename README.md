# Repository Description 

## Python Algorithms: Binary Search, Bubble Sort, Dijkstra's Algorithm, Quick Sort 

This repository contains examples of fundamental algorithms written in Python. They include binary search, bubble sort, Dijkstra's algorithm, and quick sort. Each of these algorithms is a basic building block that can be used in solving more complex problems in programming.

### Binary Search
Binary search is an efficient search algorithm that operates by dividing a sorted list in half and checking whether the item sought is in the first or second half.

### Bubble Sort
Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, swapping each pair of adjacent items if they are in the wrong order.

### Dijkstra's Algorithm
Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths from one vertex in a graph to all others. It is particularly useful in solving pathfinding problems in networks, such as route finding in maps.

### Quick Sort
Quick sort is a highly efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy. It partitions the list into two sublists around a "pivot" element, then recursively sorts the sublists.

Each algorithm includes detailed comments explaining how it works. We hope this repository will be helpful in learning about algorithms and improving your Python programming skills.
